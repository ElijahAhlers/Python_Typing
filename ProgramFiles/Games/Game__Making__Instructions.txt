Instructions to make your own game and add it to the typing program:

First things first, you shouldn't do your development inside the typing program for two reasons:
    1: It takes forever to get to your game while debugging
    2: If there is a syntax or import error in your code, none of the games will work

I would recommend making your own kivy app to put your layout in and fixing the imports later


Here are the rules for your game:

1: File tree:

When building your game, everything your game requires must go into one folder labeled whatever you
want your game named.  That way, your code stays organized and our program knows what to do with it

You also must have your main file named the same as your folder

Lastly, you must have your root kivy game layout defined as a class called: {Your game here}_Layout
where {Your game here} is the name of your folder and file

2: Stuff I give you:

When I initialize your game, I pass you my manager object.  This allows you to easily record your results
and switch away from your game when you need to.

Make sure you keep this manager reference for future use in your game

3: Stuff you can do

By giving you the manager object, I allow you to simply record results and switch away from your window

Whenever you want to switch away, just call manager.leave_me()

This will send the user back to the games menu

This does not close your window, and upon re-entry, everything will be as you left it

I leave the resetting up to you


You also don't have to worry about dealing with our results file tree.

When it is time to record results, just call manager.record_results()

This takes a few parameters, looking like this:
manager.record_results(
    Name of Game as string,
    Score of game as number,
    Time spent playing game as number in seconds)

You are required to keep track of how long your game was played.

4: Importing

When all is said and done, you need to change all your imports

To import anything in your file, you need to go through Games.Your Game

Example:
    from Games.Zerg_Rush.Modules import MyModule

To access any file, you need to go through Games/Your Game

Example:
    open('Games/Zerg_Rush/MyFile.txt')


That's it!  Your done!


Notes:

If you are having errors with ids in kivy, try to define your ids as global

TechWithTim.net has awesome kivy tutorials in which he shows you how to do that

Happy Coding!
