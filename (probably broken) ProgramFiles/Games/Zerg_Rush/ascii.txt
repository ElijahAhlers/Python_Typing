i just got mad at Calvary for not taking into account what students think
he knows i believe that, but doesn't agree
in my apparently "twisted" opinion, I think that the people in the school know how the school should change
but in his opinion, the administration and teachers always know what is best for the students without the students input

but in government, we learn that the governing body should follow the same rules they put in place for the governed
there should not be a category over the law
hence the reason I get frustrated with the school
they don't take me into account
