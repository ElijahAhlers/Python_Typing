Are you now keyboarding with stationary hands?  Are your wrists low and relaxed but off the border of the keyboard?  Do you endeavor to keep your fingers well curved and upright and execute all keyboard reaches with the fingers only?  Do you space quickly after every word and begin the next word immediately?  At line endings, do you make the return quickly with an immediate start of the new line?  Do you remember to keep your finger close to the keys when operating the keyboard?  Do you activate every key with a snap strike made by the correct individual finger?  If you can answer in the affirmative to these questions, you should be making a effective growth in speed.  As you remember, your objective in this writing is to increase your overall speed by at least six words a minute.  If you followed carefully the purpose given for each technique activity, and made a diligent effort to make a refinement in your technique pattern and to eliminate all unproductive motions as you operated the keyboard, you should reach this objective.  If you do not increase your speed by at least six word a minute, you may want to make a concerned evaluation of your keyboarding form, and then do the selected technique drills given in the lessons of this unit.
