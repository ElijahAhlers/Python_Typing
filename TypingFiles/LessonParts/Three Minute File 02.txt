Do you think it is all right to cheat as long as you do not get caught?  Some people do.  They think that what they get away with does not concern anyone except themselves.  If you cheat to move ahead, you deny someone else the right to the prize, and that is wrong.  Some of the major rules by which we live have been devised to protect us from one another; that is, to prevent one person or group from taking unfair advantage of another person or group.  Equally important tenets are intended to keep us from being unfair to ourselves.
