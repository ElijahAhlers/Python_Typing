Typewriter spacing is regular; that is, each letter of the alphabet uses the same amount of space.  Most type used by printers, though, varies in space; that is, wide letters take more space than narrow ones.  Every line of typed copy lines up at the left side but usually not at the right.  Printers can force lines of different lengths to align at the right side by adjusting the space between words.  As you copy from print, then, do not expect every line to stop at quite the same point.  Many students and more than a few teachers are puzzled by this peculiar quality of print.
