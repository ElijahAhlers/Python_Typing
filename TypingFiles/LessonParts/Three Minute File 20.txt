It is well-known that computer systems are now widely accepted as tools that organizations use to run and manage office affairs.  As a tool, the system must be maintained just as the tools of a builder, for example, must be maintained.  A wide variety of technical people is needed to establish and support a system; this need has created a demand for a number of different kinds of specialists.  Some of these specialists are needed to design and care for the hardware or equipment; others are needed to develop and maintain software or programs.
