You may have noticed that until now the lines you have keyed have been even at the right as well as at the left if you keyed them properly.  They were written that way to aid your learning.  Next, you will learn to work from materials in which the lines vary in length by seven or eight letters.  When lines vary in length, they are centered on a page according to the longest line in the copy.  You can quickly learn how to center copy, a major concern for a keyboarder.  You will then not have to puzzle about how to place letters and reports on a page so that they will draw the eye.
