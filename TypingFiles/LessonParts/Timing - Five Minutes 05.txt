While in school or at a job, some people will always do better than others.  Many of these people do good work, but what makes a select few of them do better than others who are just as intelligent and capable as they are?  The approach these few take to what they are capable of, what their goals are, and what the outcome of their actions are going to be may be what makes them different from the rest.  It may surprise you to know that "superformers" are not workaholics.  They do not take pride in being indispensable, or gloat about never having the time to take a vacation, or tie up hours and hours buried in "work."  To the contrary, the superformers manage their stress well, take vacations, and know when to stop working.  And just as important is the fact that they do not set limits on their capabilities; rather, they challenge any limits they may feel.  Superformers are motivated by compelling personal goals.  Not only do they avoid being comfortable and unchallenged in their work, but they also thrive on ways to surpass previous levels of accomplishment.  Even though superformers work well with a team, they set personal goals that surpass the team goals.  Their personal goals motivate them much more than the group goals.
