Few people know which direction their lives may take or by what road they may travel to their final destination.  When they come to a crossroad, many stop to decide which road to take.  Many take the easy road and puzzle over what might have happened on the road not taken.  Who of us knows exactly what we shall want tomorrow?  None of us, hopefully, makes a choice that cannot at some point in the future be changed.  All of us should pause from time to time and ask ourselves what we desire from life and, if necessary, choose a new road to follow to obtain our goals.  Unfortunate, indeed, are those with no purpose in life, people who have set no major goals to investigate or to pursue.
