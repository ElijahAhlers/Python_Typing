At some time in our lives, each of us has tossed a pebble into a pool and then watched the ever-increasing concentric circles radiate out from a common center; the point where the pebble entered the water.  Our relationships with others are similar -- they can be seen as existing on various levels -- concentric circles radiating out from each of us.  The people in the inner circle are our close friends.  They are the people to whom we became attached by feelings of deep personal regard; they are the people we refer to as "pals, buddies, chums, sidekicks, sisters, and brothers," and other such words.  As we move outward to other circles, we find our casual friends.  These are the people who share a common interest with us in such things as sports, clubs, music, and the like.  Still farther out in the concentric circles are acquaintances.  These are the people who may or may not become our friends.
