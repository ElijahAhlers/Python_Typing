As you build your keying power, the number of errors you make is not very important because most of the errors are accidental and incidental.  Realize, however, that documents are expected to be without flaw.  A letter, report, or table that contains flaws is not usable until it is corrected.  So find and correct all of your errors.  The best time to detect and correct your errors is while the copy remains in the machine or on a monitor.  Therefore, just before you remove the copy from the machine or screen, proofread it and correct any errors that you have made.  Learn to proofread carefully and to correct your errors quickly.  This is the way to improve your productivity.
