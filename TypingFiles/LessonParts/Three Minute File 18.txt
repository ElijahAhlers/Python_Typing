In deciding upon a career, learn as much as possible about what individuals in that career do.  For each job class, there are job requirements and qualifications that must be met.  Analyze these tasks very critically in terms of your personality and what you like to do.  A high percentage of jobs in major careers demand education or training after high school.  The training may be very specialized, requiring intensive study or interning for two or more years.  You must decide if you are willing to expend so much time and effort.  After you have decided upon a career to pursue, discuss the choice with parents, teachers, and others.  Such people can help you design a plan to guide you along the series of steps required in pursuing your goal.  Keep the plan flexible and change it whenever necessary.
