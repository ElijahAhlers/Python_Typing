A job description is a formal statement of the duties performed by a worker.  It may include both quality and quantity factors.  The job description is used to select new workers and place them in jobs that best fit their abilities.  A brief summary of the job description may be given to people who show interest in working for a company.  A performance appraisal form is a formal method of assessing the performance of workers.  It defines each level of excellence a person may reach.  It then lists in major groups the duties workers in a job class perform.  The supervisor rates the person on each duty, using a scale of one to five, with a rating of three representing the standard.  A job description and an appraisal form may have a section on work habits:  attitude on the job, working well with others, proper use of time, skill in writing and speaking, and initiative.  When a job is done equally well by two workers, the one who shows better work habits and attitudes will usually get the prized promotion or pay increase.
