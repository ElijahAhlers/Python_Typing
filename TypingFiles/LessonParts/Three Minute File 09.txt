Words are the major building blocks of written communication, and the keyboard is a very vital tool we use to put those words on paper with speed and ease.  To develop an effective message, we must choose our words precisely and arrange them into clear paragraphs.  Some communication experts say we think in words; others insist that words follow our thoughts.  Quite simply, however, we do not draft really good messages unless we make at least a mental plan first and then select carefully each of the words to execute our plan.  All who keyboard with skill can record their ideas at a machine more quickly than in longhand.  Therefore, jotting down the main ideas of a message before starting to compose is critical.  The prize for a good letter or report depends on planning as well as actual writing.
