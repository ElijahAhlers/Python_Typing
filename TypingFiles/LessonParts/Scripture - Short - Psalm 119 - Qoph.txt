With my whole heart I cry; answer me, O LORD!  I will keep your statutes.  I call to you; save me, that I may observe your testimonies.  I rise before dawn and cry for help; I hope in your words.  My eyes are awake before the watches of the night, that I may meditate on your promise.  Hear my voice according to your steadfast love; O LORD, according to your justice give me life.  They draw near who persecute me with evil purpose; they are far from your law.  But you are near, O LORD, and all your commandments are true.  Long have I known from your testimonies that you have founded them forever.
