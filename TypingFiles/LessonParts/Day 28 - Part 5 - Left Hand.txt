Please do all the numbers correctly.  If you will follow the pattern that I give you in this file you will be typing correctly.  I move across the keyboard from left pinkie to left index finger.  Your a finger goes down for z, up for q, and even further up to the 1:  a q 1 az aq aza1 aq1 aq a1 a1q aq1 a1a1a1.  Your s finger goes down for x, up for w, and even further up to the 2:  s w 2 s w 2 sx swsx sx2 sw2 s2 s2w s2s2s2.  Your d finger goes down to c, up to the e, and even further up to the 3: d e 3 d e 3 dc dcde3 dc3 de d3 de3 de3 d3e d3d3d3d.  Your f finger goes down to the v, down and to the right for the b, over to the g, up to the r, and up and over to the t: fv fv fb fb fvb fbv fg fg fr ft frt ftr frt.  The f also does the numbers 4 and 5:  f4 f5 f4 f5 f45 f54.  So here is each row.  zaq1 zaq1 xsw2 xsw2 cde3 cde3 vfr4 vfr4 bgt5 bgt5
