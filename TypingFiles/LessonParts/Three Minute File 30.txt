The Dance by Garth Brooks.  Looking back on the memory of the dance we shared beneath the stars above.  For a moment, all the world was right.  How could I have known you'd ever say goodbye?  And now I'm glad I didn't know the way it all would end, the way it all would go.  Our lives are better left to chance.  I could have missed the pain, but I'd of had to miss the dance.  Holding you, I held everything.  For a moment, wasn't I the king?  But if I'd only known how the king would fall, hey, who's to say, you know I might have changed it all.  And now, I'm glad I didn't know the way it all would end, the way it all would go.  Our lives are better left to chance, I could have missed the pain, but I'd of had to miss the dance.  Yes, my life is better left to chance.  I could have missed the pain, but I'd of had to miss the dance.
