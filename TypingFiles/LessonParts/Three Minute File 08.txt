A great many people alibi that if they could only stop the clock or hold the hands of time, they could accomplish whatever they desire to do.  Unfortunately, time marches on whether human beings do or not.  The question therefore becomes not how can we acquire more time for ourselves, but how can we utilize more productively the time allotted us.  Learning to use time wisely is a major step toward success.  Time is a constant, for everyone has an equal amount of it.  How we use time, however, is a critical variable in the equation of excellence.  Thinking requires time, of course; but we can conserve our time by taking time to plan before beginning our work.  The likelihood of having to do work over is decreased by thinking through all related problems and planning the project before starting work.
