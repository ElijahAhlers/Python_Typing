Your hands have made and fashioned me; give me understanding that I may learn your commandments.  Those who fear you shall see me and rejoice, because I have hoped in your word.  I know, O LORD, that your rules are righteous, and that in faithfulness you have afflicted me.  Let your steadfast love comfort me according to your promise to your servant.  Let your mercy come to me, that I may live; for your law is my delight.  Let the insolent be put to shame, because they have wronged me with falsehood; as for me, I will meditate on your precepts.  Let those who fear you turn to me, that they may know your testimonies.  May my heart be blameless in your statutes, that I may not be put to shame!
