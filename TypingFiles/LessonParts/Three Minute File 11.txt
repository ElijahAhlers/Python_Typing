You have learned a great many things since you began a keyboarding course.  Not only have you built good operational technique with speed, you have also grown confident in using a machine with ease and control as you key a letter, report, or other document.  Although you have learned a lot, there is much yet for you to master.  For example, you should learn to format additional letter and report styles because they are widely used in business.  You can format simple tables; however, you have not attempted a complex one.  Just as speed and accuracy on straight copy are highly prized, so is the ability to process with efficiency a wide variety of documents that are used for both personal and business needs.  Another term of directed practice will push you to higher skill in both areas.
