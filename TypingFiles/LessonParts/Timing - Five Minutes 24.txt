How well do my employees do their work?  This is a question that a good supervisor often ponders.  Supervisors are always observing the way in which their workers do their jobs and, in effect, are evaluating the work they do and their value to the organization.  In some firms, this merit rating is done on a very informal basis, while in other firms there are formal procedures.  In most large companies today, employees undergo periodic ratings of the work they have done.  How can supervisors rate their employees?  The simplest way is for the supervisor to list all the workers in order of their merit.  Some companies develop checklists of appropriate items which the supervisor completes for each worker.  Forms are also used which include a number of items to be rated.  After each item is a scale on which the exact degree of proficiency can be noted.  If the workers are using skills which can be measured, a number of tests can be given to measure performance.  What is the purpose of rating employees?  The ratings are used to ascertain whether or not employees should be considered for a raise in pay, a bonus, a promotion, or if they should be fired.  Further, most of us like to know how well we are doing.  If the ratings are discussed with employees, they serve as a basis for employees to strengthen their weak points and improve the quality of their performances.  If conducted properly, a rating system can give employees a feeling of fulfillment.
