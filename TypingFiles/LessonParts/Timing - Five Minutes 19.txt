What is an office?  Thousands of years ago, the office was the site of the secrets of an organization.  A secretary, in fact, was known as the one who kept the secrets because he wrote in a secret language.  In the minds of many people, an office is just a place where you will find furniture, equipment, people, and papers of all kinds.  The office is also said to be a place where administrative functions are performed, such as preparing, storing, and distributing documents.  In the world of business today, information is not only essential but critical to the success of any company.  Executives spend most of their time making decisions which lead to the sale of goods and services to the public.  If the goals of the company are to be accomplished, the decisions made must be based on current, precise information.  Today, business thrives on data; and the lack of the facts and figures upon which to base decisions may well spell the failure of the company.  An office is something more than just a place occupied by people, equipment, furniture, and documents.  The people in an office assemble and analyze data in great amounts; they process, revise, store, print, and transmit a large volume of data.  The office is the nerve center of any company; it runs a communication network through which vital data flow.  This information makes it possible for all of the other parts of the firm to reach their goals so that success can be won.
