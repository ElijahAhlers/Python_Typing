In excess of a hundred different makes and models of personal computers are now on the market.  An amazing number of software packages are available to use in them.  Each software package has its own commands to make an operating system work.  Commands that are given in one package often do not work for another program.  An operation guide usually is prepared for each disk package.  The guide shows you how to power up and power down the system, how to format a disk, how to copy a disk if permissible, and how to perform various other major functions of which the program is capable.  It is necessary to learn the commands required to make your program function.  Do you think it is all right to cheat as long as you do not get caught?  Some people do.  They think that what they get away with does not concern anyone except themselves.  If you cheat to move ahead, you deny someone else the right to the prize, and that is wrong.  Some of the major rules by which we live have been devised to protect us from one another; that is, to prevent one person or group from taking unfair advantage of another person or group.  Equally important tenets are intended to keep us from being unfair to ourselves.
