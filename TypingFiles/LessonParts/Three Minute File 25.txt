To hear is to perceive or to sense by the ear.  To listen means to hear with quite careful attention.  Except for those with impaired hearing, hearing is easy.  Listening, on the contrary, is a difficult and an often undeveloped skill which one can perfect only practice.  To listen effectively, one must intend to hear and understand and must concentrate on what is being said.  Do not permit your mind to drift to anything else.  As you attempt to listen, think about and emphasize the idea being presented.  Think along with the speaker.  Don't let your mind get distracted by the looks or gestures of the speaker or by some noise or activity in the immediate area.  Just concentrate of the message.  Don't allow yourself to react to quickly to what is being said.  Instead, hear the whole message before you react.
