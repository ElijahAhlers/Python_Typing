What is a job?  In its larger sense, a job is a regular duty, role or function that one performs for pay.  Therefore, when you apply for and accept a job, you accept responsibility for completing a series of specified tasks such as record keeping, word processing, and data entry.  What is a career?  A career is a broad field in business, professional, or public life that permits one to progress in successive steps up the job ladder.  Whatever the tasks performed, one may have a career in law, in health services, in education, or in business, for example.  It should be very clear that a career may include many jobs, each with different ability requirements.  Realize, however, that many of the jobs leading to increasing success in most careers are better done with greater ease by people who have built a high level of keying skill.
