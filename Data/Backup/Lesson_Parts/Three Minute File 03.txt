In excess of a hundred different makes and models of personal computers are now on the market.  An amazing number of software packages are available to use in them.  Each software package has its own commands to make an operating system work.  Commands that are given in one package often do not work for another program.  An operation guide usually is prepared for each disk package.  The guide shows you how to power up and power down the system, how to format a disk, how to copy a disk if permissible, and how to perform various other major functions of which the program is capable.  It is necessary to learn the commands required to make your program function.
