One good way to build speed is called mental practice.  When not at a machine, just make believe your hands rest on a keyboard.  Next, as you mentally say words like if, also, they, city, and dizzy to yourself, quickly move the fingers through the stroking motions.  Doing so can add to speed.  Learn to read and key figures in groups.  For example, read 165 as one sixty-five and key it that way.  Tackle the longer sequences in like manner.  Read 1078 as ten seventy-eight and handle it as 2 units.  Try this for 2493, also.
