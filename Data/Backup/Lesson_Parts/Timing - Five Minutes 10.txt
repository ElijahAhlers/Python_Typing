In the lessons of this unit, try to refine your technique patterns and to improve your overall keyboarding speed by at least six words a minute.  You can accomplish this goal if you work with a purpose and keyboard the various drills at alternating levels of speed.  In a significant research study, students who followed this plan made greater speed gains than those who did not.  Just remember that it is important to maintain proper hand-and-finger position, to use snappy keystroking with the striking action in the fingers, to space quickly after each word, and to make an immediate return at the end of each line.  You will understand, too, the importance of the several other basic techniques given in this unit.  For example, you will learn to avoid unnecessary motions, such as bouncing hands and arms, moving hands up and down the keyboard, as well as the problem of looking away from the textbook copy.  The real secret of high-speed keyboarding is to keep your hands and wrists relaxed and let your fingers manipulate the keys.  If you do these things every time you keyboard, you will be amazed with your speed growth.
