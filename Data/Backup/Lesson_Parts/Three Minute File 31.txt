An excellent performance shows the true concern of the performer for the task.  It gives one a feeling of personal triumph and prompts us as a matter of habit to do our best.  Really successful men and women take great delight in their work and pursue it with a lot of dedication.  A factor common to all who succeed is the need to have a good job recognized by others.  If good work goes without notice, the desire to excel may be reduced.  Lucky, indeed, are those who can study their own performance, evaluate its quality, and do what must be done to improve.
