For many people in the early part of the century, staying in the same job with a single company or institution for their entire productive lives was not too uncommon.  Now it is thought that many fledgling workers will switch jobs several times in their working lifetimes.  The pace of change in the national job arena today requires that all people prepare themselves to move upward or outward in the same company or from firm to firm.  Such moves demand widened experience and education.  Often the moves result in better pay and benefits.  So do not envision your diploma or your initial job as the end of anything.  Recognize that they are merely milestones in the ongoing process of preparing for a richer, more responsible life.  Living is a process of becoming rather a state of being.
