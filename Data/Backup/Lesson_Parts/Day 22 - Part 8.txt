As you key copy, read it with care.  Do more than that, though; think each word, too.  You can key the word as a unit if you think it and say it in your mind.  You must realize that some words have letter sequences that are hard to type.  These are often traps for a new person who does not yet know them.  Your major purpose now should be to learn to key the easy words quickly and to drop your speed for hard ones.  Learn next to vary the speed rate.  Never sacrifice accuracy for speed, it is important that you work hard to type each word correctly the first time.
