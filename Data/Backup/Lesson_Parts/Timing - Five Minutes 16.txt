The ability to use a keyboard quickly and efficiently is a helpful tool at any level of an organization.  Office employees may use a keyboard to take orders, make reservations, or check an account; a manger may use a keyboard to send and receive mail, obtain data, or plan for the future.  A major use of the keyboard is to process documents.  With a display, storage unit, and printer, it is relatively simple to enter, revise, and produce business documents of all types.  Any person who enters the office as a keyboard operator has found that the job can be a stepping stone to bigger and better jobs.  From a position as an operator, one can progress to a specialist or trainer and then to the job of supervisor or manager.  The manager is responsible for all the work completed in the center.  He or she selects equipment, develops procedures, provides a favorable place to work, and supervises the people who process the documents.  The specific duties of a manager differ from place to place.  Most experts agree, in general terms, that all managers plan, organize, direct and control the activities of their units.  Since a manager can only attain goals through others, his or her most basic function concerns personnel.  In other words, he or she must be skilled in the art of getting along with others, including the talent to communicate with others and to motivate them to do their jobs to the best of their abilities.
