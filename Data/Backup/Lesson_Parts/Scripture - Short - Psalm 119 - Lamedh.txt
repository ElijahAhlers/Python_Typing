Forever, O LORD, your word is firmly fixed in the heavens.  Your faithfulness endures to all generations; you have established the earth, and it stands fast.  By your appointment they stand this day, for all things are your servants.  If your law had not been my delight, I would have perished in my affliction.  I will never forget your precepts, for by them you have given me life.  I am yours; save me, for I have sought your precepts.  The wicked lie in wait to destroy me, but I consider your testimonies.  I have seen a limit to all perfection, but your commandment is exceedingly broad.
