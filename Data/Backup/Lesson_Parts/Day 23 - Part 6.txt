I am now trying to learn to vary my keying rate to fit the job of keying the words.  When I learn to speed up more of the easy words, I can take time to break the longer ones into small parts and handle them quickly.  With a bit more practice, I shall be able to handle by word response more of the shorter ones that just now I must analyze and key letter by letter.  As I learn to do more of these words as units, I shall become more expert.
