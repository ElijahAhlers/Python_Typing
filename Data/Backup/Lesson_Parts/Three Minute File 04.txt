If success is vital to you, you have a distinct advantage over many people who have no particular feeling one way or the other.  The desire to succeed is helpful, for it causes us to establish goals without which our actions have little or no meaning.  Success may not necessarily mean winning the prize, but it does mean approaching a goal.  It is foolish, of course, to believe that we can all be whatever we wish to become.  It is just as foolish, though, to wait around hoping for success to overtake us.  We should analyze our aspirations, our abilities, and our limitations.  We can next decide from various choices what we best equipped with effort to become.
