Figures and words share a lot in common as far as ease of keying is concerned.  A balanced-hand word or number may be keyed more easily than a one-hand one.  Through practice you learn to speed up easy ones and to slow down for others.  Two-digit numbers like 16, 37, 49, and 85 that you key with both hands are easy.  Longer ones like 142 and 790 are harder since each one is handled by only one of your hands.  Copy that is written by hand, called script, is not as easy to key as copy shown in type.  Writing is less easy to read than type is; as a result, the keying speed is reduced.
