Several important elements affect fatigue and eyestrain when a computer is operated.  A computer monitor should be exactly positioned so you can look directly at it, and there should be little or no reflection from it.  The keyboard should be placed in a position that is very comfortable for you as you are operating it.  A good guide is to place the keyboard so that the tips of the fingers, the base of the hand, and the lower arm are in alignment with the angle of the keyboard.  This position of the keyboard results in reduced operating fatigue.  Another key requirement in relation to position of the keyboard is the need of an adjustable, comfortable chair which may help to make it easy to operate the keyboard and view the monitor.  Still another important element is the color of the screen.  Some workers have selected an amber color; others maintain that green produces much less stress and is easier on the eyes.  In addition, the copy on the screen must be easy to read.  Size of pronto is important, but of greater importance is the intensity of the print on the screen, a condition of the number of dots that comprise each letter.
