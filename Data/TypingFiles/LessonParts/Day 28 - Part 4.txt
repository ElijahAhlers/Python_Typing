When you aim to do better something that you cannot do as well as you wish, you try again.  You do not just repeat old actions; or if you do, you do not improve.  Rather, you repeat the general responses but with some change in the act.  The next time you are asked to do the drill again, try to use a better method.  Try to make quick, precise motions and let your mind tell the fingers what to do.  Size up the problem and learn better ways of increasing your speed.
