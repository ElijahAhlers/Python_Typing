Character is often described as a person's combined moral or ethical strength.  Most people think it is like integrity which is thought to be a person's ability to adhere to a code or a set standard of values.  If a person's values are accepted by society, others are likely to view her or him as having a somewhat high degree of integrity.  You need to know that character is a trait that everyone possesses and that it is formed over time.  A person's character reflects his or her definition of what is good or just.  Most children and teenagers mold their character through the words and deeds of parents, teachers, and other adults with whom they have regular contact.  Existing character helps mold future character.  It is important to realize that today's actions can have a lasting effect.  For that reason, there is no better time than now to make all your words and deeds speak favorably.  You want them to portray the things others require of people who are thought to possess a high degree of character.
