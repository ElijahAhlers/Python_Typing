The LORD is my portion; I promise to keep your words.  I entreat your favor with all my heart; be gracious to me according to your promise.  When I think on my ways, I turn my feet to your testimonies; I hasten and do not delay to keep your commandments.  Though the cords of the wicked ensnare me, I do not forget your law.  At midnight I rise to praise you, because of your righteous rules.  I am a companion of all who fear you, of those who keep your precepts.  The earth, O LORD, is full of your steadfast love; teach me your statutes!
