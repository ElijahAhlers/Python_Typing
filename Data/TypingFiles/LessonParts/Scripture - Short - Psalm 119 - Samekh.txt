I hate the double-minded, but I love your law.  You are my hiding place and my shield; I hope in your word.  Depart from me, you evildoers, that I may keep the commandments of my God.  Uphold me according to your promise, that I may live, and let me not be put to shame in my hope!  Hold me up, that I may be safe and have regard for your statutes continually!  You spurn all who go astray from your statutes, for their cunning is in vain.  All the wicked of the earth you discard like dross, therefore I love your testimonies.  My flesh trembles for fear of you, and I am afraid of your judgments.
