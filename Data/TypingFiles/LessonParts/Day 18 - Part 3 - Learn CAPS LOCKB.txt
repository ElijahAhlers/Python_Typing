Please use the CAPS LOCK when you have at least three capital letters in a row.  For example, please use CAPS LOCK when typing the letters CLHS, but not for capitalizing less than three capital letters like MO.  Please use the left pinkie finger to touch the CAPS LOCK key immediately before you need to capitalize long strings of letters and do not forget to turn it off when you are done with them.  Here is some excellent practice using the CAPS LOCK key.  CPA or IRA but not JoAnn.  FBLA and MSU but not AZ.  Is this making sense?  Use it for PBS and FOX and even ABC but don't try to use it for combinations of only two capital letters like OK.
