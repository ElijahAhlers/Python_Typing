Everybody likes to feel successful.  Success raises our self-confidence, increases our motivation, and makes us feel happy.  At various times in our lives, however, all of us will experience failure, frustration, and disappointment.  Although most people would regard these as negative experiences, they can be positive.  Success can also be negative.  What we all need to do is to find a balance between those experiences that are successful and those that are not.  Too much success can be bad.  Too much success can give us an unrealistic view of the world around us and of ourselves.  The same perspective is true of people who experience too much failure.  The main difference, however, is that the person who has experienced too much success may feel that he or she can do no wrong, while the person who has experienced too much failure may feel that he or she can do no right.  The extreme in either case is not good.  Failure can be very positive.  It can point the way to success by showing us areas that need to be strengthened.  Failure can also help us want to do better.  Frustration can teach us to be more tolerant toward ourselves and others.  It can also give us a desire to do something to get rid of the tension in similar situations we may face in the future.
