A part-time or summer job pays more than money.  Although the money earned is important, the work experience gained has a greater long-term value when one applies for a full-time job after graduation from school.  Job application forms (the application blank and the personal data sheet) ask you to list jobs you have held and to list as references the names of individuals who supervised your work.  As one young person was heard to remark, "You can't get a job without experience and you can't get experience without a job."  That dilemma can be overcome, however, by starting to work early in life and by accepting simpler jobs that have no minimum age limit and do not require experience.  Start early at jobs that may not pay especially well but help to establish a working track record:  baby-sitting, delivering newspapers, mowing lawns, assisting with gardening, and the like.  Use these work experiences as springboards for such later jobs as sales clerk, gas station attendant, fast food worker, lifeguard, playground supervisor assistant, and office staff assistant (after you have developed basic office skills).  As you progress through these work exploration experiences, try increasingly to get jobs that have some relationship to your career plans.  If, for example, you want a career involving frequent contact with people-as in sales-seek part-time and summer work that gives you experience in dealing with people (Hamel, 1989, 10).
