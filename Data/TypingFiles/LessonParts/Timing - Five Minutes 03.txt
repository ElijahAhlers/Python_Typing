For the following words please emphasize curved, upright fingers:  as in at my be no we on up are you get him was oil dear only were upon date look data pull best link area jump card lump rate hook case water after union state imply great pupil staff nylon extra plump react jump.  Now we will emphasize independent finger movements and typing quietly.  Practice on these words:  you are my case in my opinion were you great pupil extra jump are upon after taxes were you only my address minimum decrease exaggerated poll only after you were exaggerated opinion estate tax you are in you read.  For this last exercise we will emphasize keeping the fingers close to the keys.  Begin now.  In my opinion, estate taxes decreased only after Junko asserted facts.  Only after Wes stated my exaggerated opinion were oil taxes decreased.  Only after Ki acted on my reserved opinion were water rates decreased.  Now try all of the things we were just doing:  curved, upright fingers; quiet hands; and keep your fingers close to the keys.  It is no exaggeration to say that the decrease in rainfall has resulted in water reserves which are far below the average required for safety.  We were told to refer this water problem to the committee for attention.  New plans probably will be drafted after this committee has made a minimum study of the water problem.
