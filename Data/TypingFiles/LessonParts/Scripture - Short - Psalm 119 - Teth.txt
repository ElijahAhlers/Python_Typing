You have dealt well with your servant, O LORD, according to your word.  Teach me good judgment and knowledge, for I believe in your commandments.  Before I was afflicted I went astray, but now I keep your word.  You are good and do good; teach me your statutes.  The insolent smear me with lies, but with my whole heart I keep your precepts; their heart is unfeeling like fat, but I delight in your law.  It is good for me that I was afflicted, that I might learn your statutes.  The law of your mouth is better to me than thousands of gold and silver pieces.
