Typewriter spacing is regular; that is, each letter of the alphabet uses the same amount of space.  Most type used by printers, though, varies in space; that is, wide letters take more space than narrow ones.  Every line of typed copy lines up at the left side but usually not at the right.  Printers can force lines of different lengths to align at the right side by adjusting the space between words.  As you copy from print, then, do not expect every line to stop at quite the same point.  Many students and more than a few teachers are puzzled by this peculiar quality of print.  An excellent performance shows the true concern of the performer for the task.  It gives one a feeling of personal triumph and prompts us as a matter of habit to do our best.  Really successful men and women take great delight in their work and pursue it with a lot of dedication.  A factor common to all who succeed is the need to have a good job recognized by others.  If good work goes without notice, the desire to excel may be reduced.  Lucky, indeed, are those who can study their own performance, evaluate its quality, and do what must be done to improve.
