Please use the proper fingers.  I am scared that some of you are not typing the way that I have taught you.  Please understand that I want each of you to be able to type as quickly as possible.  The best way to type accurately and quickly is to type the way that I have taught.  Please use the d finger to go down to hit the c button.  Practice it:  d c d c d c dc cd cd dc dcd.  Please use the f finger to go up to r and up and over to t.  Practice it:  f r f t f r f t frt frt frft ftr ftr fr ft f r f t ftr.  Now use the f finger to move up to the 4 and the 5.  The f goes up to r and further up to 4, f goes up and over to t and farther up and over to 5.  Practice it:  fr f4 ft f5 frt f45 fr4 ft5 fr4 ft5 f4 f5 f4 f5 f45 frt f54.  Thank you.  I hope that this helps you to increase your accuracy and speed.
