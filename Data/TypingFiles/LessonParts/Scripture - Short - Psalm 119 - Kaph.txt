My soul longs for your salvation; I hope in your word.  My eyes long for your promise; I ask, "When will you comfort me?"  For I have become like a wineskin in the smoke, yet I have not forgotten your statutes.  How long must your servant endure?  When will you judge those who persecute me?  The insolent have dug pitfalls for me; they do not live according to your law.  All your commandments are sure; they persecute me with falsehood; help me!  They have almost made an end of me on earth, but I have not forsaken your precepts.  In your steadfast love give me life, that I may keep the testimonies of your mouth.
