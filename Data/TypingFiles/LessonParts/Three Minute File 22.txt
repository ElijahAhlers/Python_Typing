Although friendships require effort to develop, they are also rewarding.  As Abraham Lincoln said, "The better part of one's life consists of his friendships."  Further, all of us know that our sense of well-being is often enhanced by the quality of our interpersonal relationships with friends.  As a result of a friendship, we have often been influenced not only to think differently about things, but also to transform our attitudes about life.  By their reactions to us, friends help teach us acceptable social behavior.  "Friends help cushion our personalities and reassure us about our values as people."  Even teacher student interpersonal relationships have been found crucial to student intellectual growth.  Consider the myth that students need only have intellectually resourceful and knowledgeable teachers to grow intellectually.  When the data are examined, it is found that teachers who provide a sound emotional relationship with students elicit as much as five times the achievement growth over the course of a year as those who coldly pursue intellectual development.
