Once you have found a job, it may be more difficult to keep it than it was to find it.  The criteria for selecting office workers are chiefly objective in nature.  Workers are chosen on the basis of their ability to keyboard quickly and accurately, to prepare business documents, to use standard office machines, and to pass a standardized test on language skills.  Based on these tests, the persons with the best skills are selected.  Only a small number of those who lose their jobs do so because they lack the proper skills to do a good job.  A number of studies have been made which indicate that poor work patterns and bad personality traits are two of the major reasons given by employers for the firing of office workers.  These include the failure to adapt to the work situation, a lack of cooperation, the inability to get along with other employees, and frequent absences for reasons other than illness.  Employers today expect a great deal more from their office workers then secretarial skills.  They seek employees who will display sincere interest in their jobs, who will take pride in their work, and who will persevere until all the tasks they have been requested to do have been completed.  They also seek employees who can follow directions exactly and use their time to the best advantage, who are on the job unless they are ill, and who possess the ability to get along well with others.
