Workers on the job have to plan their workdays and organize their work so that all duties are done in a timely fashion.  As a result, much is being said about teaching students to prioritize work.  The truth is that novice office workers have only limited opportunities to set their own priorities; rather, priorities are often set for them.  For example, in a word processing center a supervisor receives the work from various document writers.  He or she then assigns the work to keyboard operators on the basis of their work loads and in the sequence of immediacy of need.  Even a private secretary is often told by the "boss" which work is urgent and which may not be needed immediately.  As workers develop on the job and are given a greater variety of tasks to perform, the need to set priorities increases.  By then, however, they will have learned through their supervisors which types of tasks take priority and which ones can be put off.  Realize that priorities grow out of the immediacy or timeliness of need.
