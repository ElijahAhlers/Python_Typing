Now it is up to me to build a major skill to prize.  I will develop my speed if I will key the copy in the right way.  To reach the next goal, I must move quickly from one letter to another.  A step to which I must give attention in the days just ahead is reading.  The size of the word can limit how I read and key it.  I must focus on a short, easy word and then key it as a unit.
