As a result of technological advances in equipment and methods, many changes are being made in the modern office.  The use of the computer continues to grow by leaps and bounds because of its ability to process figures with amazing speed and accuracy.  In a matter of seconds or minutes the computer can process numerical data which, in the past, took hours or days.  These data, in turn, help people to make judgements or decisions which a computer is unable to do.  New equipment is now available that will improve the processing of words.  Included are machines which permit a person to make changes at the keyboard.  Errors can be corrected merely by backspacing and entering the correct information.  As it is entered, the material is recorded in memory.  After the text has been entered and edited, the operator can put a sheet of paper in the machine or printer, press a key, and the copy will be printed at a high rate of speed.  Most of the new equipment for processing figures and words have one thing in common-they are operated through the use of a typewriter keyboard.  Although these keyboards may not be identical, the location of the letter keys is almost always the same.  As a result, an operator can learn to run one of the new machines with little or no difficulty.  For the speedy and accurate operator, these machines open new horizons.
