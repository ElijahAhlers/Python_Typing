Friendships, then, require a deep personal involvement with others, being interested in their well-being, in their unique identities, and in their perceptions of the world.  Real friends like and accept us for what we are, just as we like and accept them for what they are.  To build friendships, we need to be ourselves, take the risk of reaching out, and say "hello" first.  We need to show we care.  As Henry David Thoreau said, "The most I can do for my friend is just be his friend."  Perhaps the following power, attributed to Albert Camus, best describes the mutual acceptance and closeness that characterize real friendship.  Don't walk in front of me, I may not follow.  Don't walk behind me, I may not lead.  Walk beside me and just be my friend.
