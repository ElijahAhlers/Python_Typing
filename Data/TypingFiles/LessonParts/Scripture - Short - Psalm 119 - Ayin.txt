I have done what is just and right; do not leave me to my oppressors.  Give your servant a pledge of good; let not the insolent oppress me.  My eyes long for your salvation and for the fulfillment of your righteous promise.  Deal with your servant according to your steadfast love, and teach me your statutes.  I am your servant; give me understanding, that I may know your testimonies!  It is time for the LORD to act, for your law has been broken.  Therefore I love your commandments above gold, above fine gold.  Therefore I consider all your precepts to be right; I hate every false way.
