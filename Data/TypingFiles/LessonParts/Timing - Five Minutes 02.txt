The experts who design, build, and modify computer equipment are known to us as computer engineers.  An advanced mastery of both the areas of electronics and mechanics is needed by these people if they are to do their jobs properly.  From the first day a system is installed, a business must begin to upgrade the new system; the new system must be adapted to the needs of each individual business, and continuous improvements must be made if optimum results are to be realized.  Thus, a computer engineer's job does not end once the system is installed, and her or his expertise is important if the system is going to work.  There are two kinds of software experts.  The ones who deal with the programs that control only the operation of the computer are the computer scientists; also, they set up the programs that make sure that the equipment gives valid results.  Those who develop the programs to process the data are the application programmers; they also write the codes that instruct a computer to perform the given tasks and solve the various problems.  The skills of both kinds of experts are needed to make sure the system works.
