Have you realized that the numbers are easy to remember if you can count your fingers?  Starting with the left pinkie, you will count fingers moving left to right.  The a finger goes up to 1, the s finger goes up to 2, the d finger goes up to 3, the f finger goes up to 4 and also to 5.  On your right hand, your pointer finger goes from j up to 6 as well as to 7, the ring finger goes from k up to 8, the ring finger goes from l up to 9, and your right pinkie goes from ; up to 0.  So, try your left hand with the correct fingers to produce 1 2 3 4 5 and then use your right hand to produce 6 7 8 9 0.
