Few people have enough time to accomplish everything they desire.  Those who appear to accomplish many of the things that they attempt to do make choices regarding the most valuable uses of their time.  They set up a series of major and minor goals and allocate their time to these goals on the basis of relative value in terms of the time requirement.  First, determine exactly what it is you desire to have or to do.  Next, analyze your behavior or actions to see whether they are helping or hindering your progress toward your objectives.  On the basis of this self-analysis, devise a plan for time use that is unique to your own situation.  Practice self-management until it becomes a habit.
