Please do all the numbers correctly.  If you will follow the pattern that I give you in this file you will be typing correctly with your right hand.  I move across the keyboard from left index finger to left pinkie.  Your j finger goes down for n, to the left for h, up for y, and even further up for 6.  Try it:  n h y n h y 6 6y 6h 6n 6yhn nhy6.  Your j finger also goes straight down for m, straight up for u, and even further up for 7.  Try it:  n j u 7 mj u7 7j 7m mju7 mju7 7ujm.  Your k finger goes down for , up for i and further up for 8.  Try it ,ki8 ,ki8 8i 8k 8, ,ki8 8ik,.  Your l finger goes down for ., up for o, and further up for 9.  Try it:  .lo9 .lo9 9o 9l 9. 9.lo 9ol.  Your ; finger goes down for / up for p, and further up for 0.  Try it.  ;p0 ;/ /;p0 0p;/.  Don't forget that your pinkie on your right hand can also be used for ' and ".  Try it ' " ' " ' ".   So here is each row.  nhy6 mju7 ,ki8 .lo9 /;p0 0p;/ 9ol. 8ik, 7ujm 6yhn
