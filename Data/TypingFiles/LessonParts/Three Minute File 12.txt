Human relations skills on the job are very critical in terms of how you will be perceived by peers as well as by superiors.  During your early weeks at work, you will be sized up quickly by coworkers.  How they observe and evaluate you will help to determine whether your work experience will be pleasant, successful, and valuable.  Be cautious at first and do not align yourself closely with any of the cliques that often develop in the workplace.  Show understanding and be courteous to everybody, but don't take sides in a dispute that may occur between members of any group of workers.  Show that you can think for yourself, but don't convey your ideas too freely.  Look, listen, and learn before you take an active part in the politics of the workplace.  Let the older, experienced workers be the agents of change.  Study and learn from them and carefully notice what seems to cause their successes or failures.  As you develop on a job, all positive human relations skills will be rewarded.
